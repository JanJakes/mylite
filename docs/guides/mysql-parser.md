# MySQL Parser

Build the prototype parser:

```sh
make
```

Parse one statement:

```sh
bin/mylite-parse "SELECT 1"
```

The CLI reports statement kind plus token and byte spans:

```text
ok statements=1 kinds=select[1:2,0:8]
```

Dump tokens:

```sh
bin/mylite-parse --tokens "SELECT @a, ?"
```

Keyword lookup is table-driven and must remain sorted:

```sh
python3 tests/check_keywords.py
```

Run smoke tests:

```sh
make smoke
```

Run the WordPress MySQL query corpus:

```sh
make corpus
```

The corpus target downloads the CSV fixture into `build/corpus/`, which is
ignored by Git. The current corpus reader handles the fixture's MySQL-style
backslash-escaped double quotes and verifies 69,577 records.
